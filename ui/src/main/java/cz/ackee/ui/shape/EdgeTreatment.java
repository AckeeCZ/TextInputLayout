 * setting `android:clipChildren="false"` in xml. `clipToPadding` may also need to be false if there

   * <p>EdgeTreatments have an origin of (0, 0) and a destination of (0, length) (i.e. they
   * represent the top edge), and are automatically rotated and scaled as necessary when applied to
   * other edges. Only the horizontal, top EdgeTreatment needs to be defined in order to apply it to
   * all four edges.
   *
   * @param length the length of the edge.
   * @param center the distance to the center of the edge. This takes into account any offset added
   *     by the proceeding corner. Drawing anything at (center, 0) will be center aligned with the
   *     shape. Normally you'll want to use this instead of length / 2.
   * @param interpolation the interpolation of the edge treatment. Ranges between 0 (none) and 1
   *     (fully) interpolated. Custom edge treatments can implement interpolation to support shape
   *     transition between two arbitrary states. Typically, a value of 0 indicates that the custom
   *     edge treatment is not rendered (i.e. that it is a straight line), and a value of 1
   *     indicates that the treatment is fully rendered. Animation between these two values can
   *     "heal" or "reveal" an edge treatment.
   * @param shapePath the {@link ShapePath} that this treatment should write to.
